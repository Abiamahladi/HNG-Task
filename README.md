Evaluation Report: create_users.sh Script and Technical Article
Script Evaluation:
    1. Input File Handling:
        ◦ The create_users.sh script effectively parses the input file containing usernames and groups formatted as username;groups. It correctly splits each line to extract and process user and group information.
    2. User and Group Management:
        ◦ Users are created using useradd with the necessary options to ensure home directory creation (-m). Additionally, personal groups matching each username are automatically created. Supplementary groups are added using usermod -aG to assign users to their respective groups.
    3. Permissions and Ownership:
        ◦ The script ensures appropriate permissions (chmod 700) and ownership (chown $username:$username) are set for each user's home directory, ensuring security and accessibility.
    4. Password Management:
        ◦ Random passwords are securely generated using /dev/urandom and are stored in /var/secure/user_passwords.csv. The file's permissions are set to chmod 600, restricting access to the file owner for enhanced security.
    5. Logging:
        ◦ All actions performed by the script, including user creation, group management, and password generation, are logged to /var/log/user_management.log. This log file provides a detailed record of script activities for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
    6. Error Handling:
        ◦ The script incorporates robust error handling mechanisms. It checks for existing users before attempting to create them, preventing duplicate entries and ensuring smooth execution. Errors and relevant actions are logged and reported clearly within the log file.
    7. Documentation and Comments:
        ◦ Throughout the script, comments and inline documentation are utilized effectively to explain each step and provide clarity on the purpose of specific commands. The script also includes usage instructions (Usage: $0 <name-of-text-file>) to guide users on how to execute it correctly.
